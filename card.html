                        <strong>My Dearest, Justin</strong>
                        <p>You were just like the rain pouring <br> to 
                            the earth. It was indeed cloudy <br> before,
                            it could be rain or back to <br> sunny day,
                            that's why I was not <br> expecting we would
                            continue <br> talking this much at first, but 
                            I'm <br> glad that we could continue to this far.</p>

                        <p>And as someone who favors the rain,<br>
                        your presence is naturally something I love.<br>
                        You've brought comfort at an unexpected time and place,
                        filling my life with joy and happiness by merely being there.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for coming, and I hope you'll stay.</p>
