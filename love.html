                <strong>Hi, again? </strong>
                <p>I know this isn't the actual "heart,"
                    but it's how I feel whenever I'm with you.
                    Even if I try to hold myself back,
                    my heart refuses, it races like crazy every time.
                    <br>I always thought of you as a breeze,
                    just enough to bring comfort,
                    but leaving me wanting more.
                    <br><br>
                    I've messed up before,
                    and I don’t want to ruin what we have.
                    That’s why I’m afraid—afraid to ask for more,
                    for your time, your affection, and your love.
                    <br><br>
                    But I can’t help it.
                    I’m only human, after all.
                    Call it selfish, but in the end,
                    I just want more.
                    I want you.</p>
